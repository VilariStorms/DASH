# DASH
### DICK ASS SHELL

Dick ass shell can do anything that your shell can do, as long as you don't expect it to work.

## Features

- It's written in D
- Sparkster wrote the code
- It's very homosexual


## Todo
- refucking factor this godawful code
- add better handling of escape character, etc
- write a fucking lexer yay :(
- ~~aliases~~ done! (kinda)
- ~~history~~ done but not pushed
- embeded lua scripting

## Installation and use.

~~uhhhh, just use dub, I haven't got round to packaging it yet.~~

- Install dub - the D language build system and dependency manager
- git clone the repo
- cd into it and run `dub -b release`

Dub will automatically run dash for you - press q to quit or type exit and press enter.
You can also run ./dash after building it the first time to start the shell. 

Run DASH and type help to get started pretty much. It's barebones but it's functional.
