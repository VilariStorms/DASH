### Download the GPG key

```
### Add repository to the apt sources list

```
### Update the apt package index

```

# To build from source:

- Install dub - the D language build system and dependency manager
- git clone the repo
- cd into it and run `dub -b release`

Dub will automatically run dash for you - press q to quit or type exit and press enter.
You can also run ./dash after building it the first time to start the shell. 

Run DASH and type help to get started pretty much. It's barebones but it's functional.
